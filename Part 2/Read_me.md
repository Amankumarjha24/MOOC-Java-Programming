  <h1>📚 Part 2: Java Programming </h1>
  <p><i>Exercises and solutions from the University of Helsinki (MOOC.fi)</i></p>
  <p>The second part of the material focuses on repetition in programs and on how to divide functionality into distinct units.</P>

### 🛠️ Topics Covered
In this section, I focused on the foundational blocks of Java:
* Recurring problems and patterns to solve them.
* Repeating funcationality (while Loop).
* More loops.
* Methods and dividing the problem into smaller parts.

### 📂 Exercise List Recuring problelms and patterns to solve them
| Exercise Name | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Squared** | A program which takes the input and prints the square of the given integer | ✅ Done |
| **Square root of sum** | A program which read the two integer and provide the square root by using Math.sqrt()  | ✅ Done |
| **Absolute value** | A program that reads an integer from the user if input less then 0 print given integer multiplied by -1 other case program prints itself | ✅ Done |
| **Coparing Numbers** | A program that reads two integer - if first number is greter then the second the program prints (first is grater then second) if the first numebr less then the second programs prints (first is less then second number)  | ✅ Done |
